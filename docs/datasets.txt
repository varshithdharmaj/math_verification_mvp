MVM2 DATASETS AND UNIFIED SCHEMA
================================

Goal
----
Use real public datasets for math reasoning (text) and OCR math (image).
Create a unified dataset format for training and evaluation.

Proposed public datasets (text)
-------------------------------
1) GSM8K
   - Format: JSONL with question, answer.
   - Size: ~8.5k training, 1.3k test.
   - Suitability: Word problems with step-by-step reasoning and final answers.

2) MATH (by Hendrycks)
   - Format: JSON with problem, solution, final answer.
   - Size: ~12.5k problems.
   - Suitability: Higher difficulty; good for generalization and error analysis.

3) SVAMP
   - Format: JSON with structured fields.
   - Size: ~1k problems.
   - Suitability: Simple arithmetic word problems; good for early testing.

Proposed public datasets (image / OCR)
--------------------------------------
1) CROHME
   - Format: InkML (handwritten math).
   - Size: Thousands of handwritten expressions.
   - Suitability: OCR pipeline evaluation.

2) Im2LaTeX-100K
   - Format: Image + LaTeX pairs.
   - Size: ~100k samples.
   - Suitability: Printed math OCR and text alignment.

3) MathVerse (image + question)
   - Format: Images + problems + answers.
   - Size: Varies by split.
   - Suitability: Multimodal math reasoning evaluation.

Unified dataset schema
----------------------
Each example in unified JSON should follow:

{
  "problem_id": "...",
  "input_type": "text" | "image",
  "input_text": "...",        // for text problems
  "image_path": "...",        // for image problems
  "ground_truth_answer": "...",
  "split": "train" | "val" | "test"
}

Notes
-----
1) Use small slices for development (100-300 samples).
2) Keep images local and store their paths in image_path.
3) Use separate train/val/test files for evaluation and training.
4) The learned classifier is trained only on the features derived from pipeline outputs.
5) LLM and OCR components are evaluated, not trained here.
